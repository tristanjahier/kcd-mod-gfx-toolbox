# GFX toolbox for Kingdom Come: Deliverance modding

This repository contains a small Python CLI toolkit to compare two `.gfx` files by extracting their AVM1 p-code, normalizing decompiler noise, and surfacing the real script logic differences.

**You need the ffdec-cli binary**, which is included with "JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler". Download it here: https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler.
